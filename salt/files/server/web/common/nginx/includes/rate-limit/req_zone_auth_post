# Rate limit settings for authentication
# ------------------------
# Specify the following in the location block of any authentication requests
	## [Rate limit settings for authentication]
	#include includes/common/rate-limit/req_zone_auth;

# [Rate limit settings for all zones]
include includes/common/rate-limit/common;

# Limit number of requests, with bursting to allow initial tries
#
# Allow up to 3 extra requests in a burst (no delay), reject excess
limit_req zone=common_auth burst=5 nodelay;

# NOTE: Delay parameter is introduced in nginx 1.15.7
# Allow 5 tries before subjecting to rate limit
# Allow 3 immediate tries, delay the next 2 (burst - delay) afterwards, then reject excess
# This reduces initial appearance of error page
#limit_req zone=common_auth burst=5 delay=3;
